Will be rewritten in other lib's. E.g:
1. DRM/KMS
2. SDL3
3. Nuklear
4. Or maybe even with the libwayland-client for fun.

Extreme and unrealistic Thought:

I wanted to use the UI with Nuklear and then render the rest with Vulkan.
And then manage and execute all of this with DRM.

But I'm wondering if I can restrict the window so that I can run it inside tmux, and then halve the window so that I can see the output on half of my screen and my terminal on the other half.
Or if I then go to the next tmux pane, that this rendering output disappears.
