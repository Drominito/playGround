# ImageFilter

*  My Small Idea with Design is on Adobe Creative Cloud
  
*  Make the Program Independent from the Files

*  Learn there how to Programm in async.

*  Upscaling & Downscaling
  
*  ColorChanging (Negative Colors, Mix Colors, Blur, Glowing)

*  Trigonometry Filters
    
*  Convert it also in VideoProgram (Several Images)
  
*  AND MAKE TO SHOW FPS

*  And maybe an API to the camera to make real time Filters
